# Dotplot-Metabolomics-R
This is a quick script to make a single variable (metabolite) comparison with a dotplot in R.

The data to use with this script is in this repository labeled "Male Liver FAMES Exp 134 (16 0).csv", which is FAMES data from a GC-MS experiment using mice liver tissue. 

Open the script and run through it with the .csv file in the same directory to view the dotplot.
